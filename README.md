Our project is based on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Goal 13: Climate Action. This is a web based project made using HTML, ReactJS library and CSS and hosted on github pages. As the project 
is hosted, and live, no tools or dependencies are required to run in other devices. One has to click the link to the webpage https://rohammaiti.github.io/Earth_guardians/ to use the project. To access the other links 
just simply click on the links and to move around the webpage, we have provided navigation links at top and bottom of the webpage as well. We have provided a google form through which we can collect data on the 
pollution level of the user's area. The website has been made device friendly as much as possible, still if any errors or bugs occur, feel free to mail us. We still recommend to use this website on desktop and laptops 
as mobile version lacks some features. To return back to the homepage quickly, we have provided buttons at the end of each webpage. This repository contains the build folder only and is also the hosting repository of 
our website. For both development and build folders visit this repsitory https://github.com/snehakha/Google-web-project.git.
